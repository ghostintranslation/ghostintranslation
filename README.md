### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm creating and open sourcing my own modular synths system. To achieve that I thought engineering a modular platform that could fit all sorts of modules would be a great idea, to reduce cost and help maintainability.

And so I created the [MOTHERBOARD](https://github.com/ghostintranslation/motherboard/), a platform that offers many possibilities and with which I created already a few modules:
[SYNTH](https://github.com/ghostintranslation/synth/), [DRONE](https://github.com/ghostintranslation/drone/), [DS909](https://github.com/ghostintranslation/ds909/), [PSYC03](https://github.com/ghostintranslation/psyc03/), [CYCLE](https://github.com/ghostintranslation/cycle/), [BYTE](https://github.com/ghostintranslation/byte/)

I showcase the modules on my Instagram and YouTube:

And you can also support me by buying my music or the PCBs to build those modules on:
