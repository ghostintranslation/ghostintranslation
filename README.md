### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm creating and open sourcing my own modular synths system. To achieve that I thought engineering a modular platform that could fit all sorts of modules would be a great idea, to reduce cost and help maintainability.

And so I created the [MOTHERBOARD](https://github.com/ghostintranslation/motherboard/), a platform that offers many possibilities. Only one module is based on its version 2 for now but more are in the works: [DRONE](https://github.com/ghostintranslation/drone/).

I showcase my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ghostintranslation/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/GhostInTranslation).
